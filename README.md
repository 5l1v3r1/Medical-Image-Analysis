Paper review : A Combined Deep-Learning and Deformable-Model Approach to Fully Automatic Segmentation of the Left Ventricle in Cardiac MRI (Avendi et al., 2015).

### Abstract 
Manual segmentation of the Left Ventricle (LV) is a tedious and meticulous task that can vary depending on the patient, the Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) cuts and the experts. Still today, we consider manual delineation done by experts as being the ground truth for cardiac diagnosticians. Thus, we are reviewing the paper - written by Avendi and al. - who presents a combined approach with Convolutional Neural Networks, Stacked Auto-Encoders and Deformable Models, to try and automate the segmentation while performing more accurately. Furthermore, we have implemented parts of the paper (around three quarts) and experimented both the original method and slightly modified versions when changing the architecture and the parameters.
